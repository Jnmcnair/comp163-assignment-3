What your game is about (your creative theme)

My game is about how going through college and how taking harder classes can effect your gpa and mental health. The creative theme has been balencing work studying and social life so your not burnt out or failing any classes.

Which branching concepts are demonstrated where

If/elif/else statements are found everywhere in my code as well as nested if statements. Lines 21-43 have if/elif/else statements and many nested if/else statements that give the user different outcomes based on their previous input and stats. Both are also used from lines 51 to 90 in order to see howw study effects the user and provide them a personalized ending from their choices and stats.

How to run the game

You first need to put the code into an IDE to be run then enter your name. Once You've done that you can simply run the code and then provide inputs whenever it is nessecary.

What the different endings represent

The different endings represent the different outcomes that can come after you've finished your senior year of college. With the endings ranging from graduating normally to graduating burnt out or not graduating at all. This represents the very basic outcomes that occur from finishing college and how a student can feel from them. 

Any AI assistance used during development

<<<<<<< HEAD
I used AI mainly for clarification on the instructions given for the assignment as they were hard to understand. I also used it for debugging and trying to figure out how identity operators work. I specifically used AI to understand the different between is not and != for the final test case.
